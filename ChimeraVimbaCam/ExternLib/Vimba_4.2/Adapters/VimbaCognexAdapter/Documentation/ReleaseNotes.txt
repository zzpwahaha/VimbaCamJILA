Cognex Adapter
- Bug fix: Acquisition timeout with multiple USB cameras

  settings tab is not written to the camera anymore.

Known Issues
------------
- Under Windows 8 Cognex has to be run as administrator in order to find the
  Vimba Cognex Adapter
- Command features cannot be executed within the 'Custom Properties' tab. 
  This has to be done via the 'Imaging Device' tab.
- 'Custom Properties' tab can only list writable features. If a feature is
  not writable during the 'Initialize acquisition' sequence it will not be shown
  in the drop down list. In this case the feature that causes the read only state
  has to be modifed. Afterwards the camera has to be closed and opened again.
- If the feature value to be set exceeds the maximum / minimum value of that feature,
  the value to be set is automatically adjusted to the maximum / minimum
